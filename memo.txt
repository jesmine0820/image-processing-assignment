Deployment: Flask

Ways to open (in terminal):
1. cd image-processing-assignment
2. python app.py
*** Ctrl+C to stop it

Data source:
1. dataset/dataset.csv (student information)
2. photos (student photos)

Data Preprocessing
- data_preprocessing.ipynb
- used to process the data before initilize the app
- no need to waste time to wait for processing in app

Database:
1. face_embeddings.pkl (basic face embeddings for the photos) -- see want to use jesmine der or ethel der
2. information.db (all student information in sql)
3. recognized_people.db (recognized people in counter 1)
